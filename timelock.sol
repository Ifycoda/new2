/*
    MOTIVATION BEHIND THE KEEPERS AND MASTER KEEPER THING 
    SOME THINKINGS;
    (1) Following the specification, it means about 45% of token supply should be transferred to the timeLock contract,
            this 45% represent the 20% share for team, 15% share for private investors, and 10% share for advisors; 
            The problem now is that the native token contract now depends on the address of this time lock contract.
            ---------------------POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS ------------------
            (a) Theres a way to get the address of a contract even before it was deployed
            (b) The token team can delegate an address to send tokens to this time lock contract when it is later deployed.
    
    MOTIVATION BEHIND THE 'lockSince' MAPPING
    (1) When a project locks funds, aside updating her balance, we need to keep track of the time the funds was lockedSince
    (2) When a keeper attempts to unlock this fund, we can easily check that this lock time has ellapsed against the current time(now),
        and then update the state.
    
    MOST OF THE CODE I WROTE HERE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED, I LEFT THAT FOR LATER AFTER EXTENSIVE REVIEW AND MODIFICATION BY TEAMMATES.
